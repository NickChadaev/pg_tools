# pg_tools
Some small tools for PostgreSQL
--------------------------------
X1 - This is a very old PostgreSQL client. It was started 20 years ago and was called xPG.
Gustavo from www.kazak.ru was the project architect. 
I am very grateful to him for his help.

I rebuild the project, fixed a lot of bugs, renamed project and used it in one
my task.

Now the project is frozen. It is a good framework for special PostgreSQL clients.
The main goal is to rebuild the Record and Query classes.

I hope, maybe the project will be useful to anyone.
--------------------------------------------------
DB_KERNEL. This is an implementation of the EAW architecture. 
I highlighted the most important and build the kernel for any application.
It is developing now.

Sorry, but this project is documented in Russian.
