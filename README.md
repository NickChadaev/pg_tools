Some small tools for PostgreSQL
--------------------------------
X1 - This is a very old PostgreSQL client. It was started 20 years ago and was called xPG. It was written in Java.
Gustavo from www.kazak.ru was the project architect. I am very grateful to him for his help.
I rebuild the project, fixed a lot of bugs, renamed project and used it in onemy task.
Now the project is frozen. It is a good framework for special PostgreSQL clients.
The main goal is to rebuild the Record and Query classes.
The X1-project has three languages: English, Spain, Russian.

I hope, maybe the project will be useful to anyone.
--------------------------------------------------

DB_KERNEL. This is an implementation of the EAW architecture. 
I highlighted the most important and build the kernel for any application.
It is developing now.

Sorry, but the "db_kernel" project is self-documented in Russian.
----------------------------------------------------------------

SEPGSQL_TOOLS. I started the mls-selinux project. This is the "trial-beta" version, the beginning of work.
The goal is to mandatory access to table tuples. Now this project self-documented in Russian.

----------------------------------------------------------------

LOAD_MAIN. The small tool for building any database from "scratch"  e.g. from sources.
