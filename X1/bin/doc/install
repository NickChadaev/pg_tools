                          XPg 0.1c (INSTALLATION)
***************************************************************************

Due to changes in the project management, now the source code and the 
binaries of XPg are included in the same compressed file, which means that 
with the same file that you downloaded, you can use XPg as an end user or 
you can to modify the source code of the project for your needs and to 
compile a new version of XPg.

***************************************************************************

 REQUIREMENTS

 - For End Users of the aplication: 

 * SDK 1.4.*

 Before the begin, you must to install the Java Standard Development 
 Kit (SDK) version 1.4.* or higher avalaible from http://java.sun.com

 - For Developers insterested in to help to this project:

 * Eclipse

 The XPg's source code what is together with this document has been organized
 as an "Eclipse Project". Eclipse is an Interface Developement Environment to
 many programming languages).
 If you wish to modify this source code or you want to compile it, then you 
 must to install Eclipse in your computer. 

                         http://www.eclipse.org

 Eclipse has been selected as the official tool for developing XPg because 
 it is an open source project and it offers a lot of funcionalities and 
 useful options as an IDE application.

 XPg INSTALLATION FOR END USERS 

 - For Unix users:

  1. Download the compress file of the project (xpg-0.1c.tar.bz2) from the 
     official web site: 
                    http://www.kazak.ws/xpg/

  2. Uncompress the file into the directory where you want to install XPg.
     i.e.:
         user% mv xpg-0.1c.tar.bz2 /home/foo
         user% cd /home/foo
         user% tar xvfj xpg-0.1c.tar.bz2

     A directory called "xpg" will be created in the path you choosed to 
     uncompress the installer.

  3. Now, you just have to create a direct access to the file "xpg.sh", which
     is located inside the directory "xpg" or if you want, you can run it from
     the start script directly:
     i.e.: 
         user% /home/pepe/xpg/xpg.sh 

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - For Windows users:

  1. Download the compress file of the project (xpg-0.1c.zip) from the
     official web site:
                    http://www.kazak.ws/xpg/

  2. Uncompress the file into the directory where you want to install XPg.
     You can do it using your graphical interface or you can use a D.O.S
     console. i.e.:
         c:/> move xpg-0.1c.zip c:/foo>
         c:/> cd c:/foo>
         c:/> unzip xpg-0.1c.zip

     The directory "xpg" will be created inside the path you choosed to 
     uncompress the installer.

  3. Now, you just have to create an direct access to the file "xpg.bat" 
     located inside the directory "xpg" or if you wish, you can run it
     from a D.O.S console. i.e.:
         c:/pepe/xpg> xpg.bat

  Note: Remember that you need the Java SDK installed in your system if you
        want to see XPg working.

 XPg SOURCE CODE INSTALLATION (FOR DEVELOPERS)

 Note: To report bugs or fails about XPg, please visit:
                    http://www.kazak.ws/xpg/bugs.php

 - For Unix users:
 
 1. Download the compressed file of the application (xpg-0.1c.tar.bz2) from 
    the official website:
                    http://www.kazak.ws/xpg/

 2. Uncompress the file into the directory called "workspace" of your 
    Eclipse installation. i.e.:
         user% mv xpg-0.1c.tar.bz2 /home/foo/eclipse/workspace
         user% cd /home/foo/eclipse/workspace
         user% tar xvfj xpg-0.1c.tar.bz2
    Or if you want:
         user% mv xpg-0.1c.tar.bz2 /home/foo/eclipse/workspace
         user% cd /home/foo/eclipse/workspace
         user% bunzip2 xpg-0.1c.tar.bz2
         user% tar xvf xpg-0.1c.tar

 3. A directory called "xpg" will be created into the directory called 
    "workspace". Now, you have to run your Eclipse version. 

 4. Inside the Eclipse interface, choose:
    "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Project into Workspace"

 5. Now, Choose the option "Next".

 6. Click on the botton "Browse" and choose the directory "xpg" from  
    the projects list.
    The option "Proyect name" should set the value "xpg" automatically. 

 7. Choose the option "Finish". From this moment,  you could to modify
    and to compile the XPg source code from Eclipse.

 8. If you want to create a direct access to the XPg application, you can 
    do it using the file "xpg.sh", located into the directory "xpg" inside 
    the directory "workspace" of your Eclipse installation.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------

- For Windows 95/98/XP users:

  The installation procedure of the XPg source code on Windows systems is 
  the same to the described above. The only difference is in the compression 
  format of the compressed file ("zip" extension what you can open with Winzip 
  or any other Windows compression tool) and the path of the directory 
  "workspace" of the Eclipse installation, which depends of the path choosed 
  by you when installed Eclipse.
